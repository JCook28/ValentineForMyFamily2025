        <h2>A Poem (Not Made By Me)</h2>
        <p>Through every laugh, through every sigh,
            <br>
            You’ve taught me love that will never die.
            <br>
            Your kindness, patience, always true,
            <br>
            A perfect Valentine’s gift is you.
            <br>
            <br>
            
            So today I send this love your way,
            <br>
            Thank you, Mom and Dad, every day.
            <br>
            For all the warmth your hearts provide,
            <br>
            You’re my forever love, my guide.</p>

        <h2>Extra Comments</h2>
        <p>I truly am thankful for everything that you have done for me and everyone else. Despite every trouble that we have caused you, please note that we still love you despite all stubborness to interactions sometimes.
            Happy Valentines Day mom and dad, I hope today or any other day can remain special in your hearts and to always keep loving us. This almost became a joke card so be thankful it isnt as well. Small mercy I shall show for my appreciation.
            I will not hold back on a whole part full of images that I have dedicated my time into working on.
            Now that I think about it, this is the first time i've written so much in a card. Probably because it's online? Anyways, may today be special somehow.
